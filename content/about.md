Being a student you discover close to ten new things about "The Programming Journey" everyday. It get's really difficult to track all those resources. That's why we came together to make this, THE DEV ViNE.

Most of us are still (broke) students that can't afford premium tools for anything, here you will find mostly the tips and tricks (free ones mostly) that we use to  get things done.

Have an awesome tool you'd like to share? Get Listed.
